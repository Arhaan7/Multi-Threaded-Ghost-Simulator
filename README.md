# Multi-Threaded-Ghost-Simulator
This project involves creating a multi-threaded ghost hunting simulation. The simulation features a map of connected rooms, ghost hunters, and a ghost. Each entity (ghosts and hunters) operates in its own thread, simulating real-time interactions in a haunted house environment.
